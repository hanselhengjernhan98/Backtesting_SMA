Creating and Backtesting an SMA Crossover Strategy
Underlying Idea: Momentum -> most recent price trend persists in the near future

SMA 50 captures the more recent price trend (vs. SMA 200)

Trading Rules:

If SMA 50 crosses above the SMA 200, this can be viewed as an indicator for further price increases (buy signal)
If SMA 50 crosses below the SMA 200, this can be viewed as an indicator for further price decreases (sell signal)
